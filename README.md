# Linear Regression Implementation in Python

## üìö Project Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a **Linear Regression** class. This project was developed as part of the academic requirements for the **"Mast√®re sp√©cialis√© en Science des Donn√©es"** program, submitted on **January 25th, 2025**.

The implementation demonstrates the mathematical foundations and coding of the **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)** method for Linear Regression, along with tools for model training, prediction, and evaluation.

## ‚ú® Features

- Implemented from scratch using Python (no high-level machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`).
- Supports:
  - Model training with the Ordinary Least Squares method.
  - Making predictions on new data.
  - Evaluating model performance using:
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    - Coefficient of Determination (R¬≤ Score)

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.7 or above installed, along with the following dependencies:

- `numpy` for matrix operations
- `matplotlib` (optional, for plotting results)
